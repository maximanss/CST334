Objectives
1. To develop multi-threaded application programs
2. To demonstrate the use of threads in matrix multiplication

a. threadHello_step1.c - This is a sample program to show how to create threads (have bugs)
b. threadHelloFixed_step1.c - This is the thread program to show how to create threads (bug fixed program from threadHello.c)
c. matrix_multiplication.c - In this program it will use threads to perform a parallel 2D matrix multiply.
        Matrix A x Matrix B = Matrix C.
        Each thread is to compute and store each column value of a row in matrix C.
        
To run the programs on Linux: make
